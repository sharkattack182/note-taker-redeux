# Note Taker

## Purpose
This was a homework assignment for the express chapter in the bootcamp. This app took so much time and caused so much stress the first time around but with a better understanding this time around I was able to complete it with little issue. The idea of the assignment was that the front end had already been built along with a db file that housed the servers data. My job was to engineer the back end.   

## Process
As mentioned before I was responsible for the backend of the assigment the front end was all given to us in a develop folder. The task was relativley easy. All the routes were pretty comon the only one I was unfamiliar with was the delete method. It wasnt too strenuous though. Overall the project took about an hour of actual working time. I used a few different dependencies including, fs, express, and path. In the post and delete routes I utilized fs.write/readfile to access the data stored in the db folder.
